Based on Paul's HeltecToSpark9
---------------------------------------

v0.34
- New functionality (preset/effect) working
- All current bugs squashed

v0.35
- Reconnect working, but some bad messages come through on reconnect
- Not visible to the user but odd. Could be the hammering of get_hardware_preset

v0.36
- Reconnect working, but some bad messages come through on reconnect
- Now cause the first preset read to fail, even on first connect
- Added timer code to check battery occasionally

v0.40
- Reverted to older reconnect code. Works well enough
- Added DEFINE to automate a Heltec vs. Discrete build
- Changed switch order and polarity to match WIFI Kit version
- Code functional but debounce not working properly yet

v0.46
- Merge code from Heltec v0.46 version
- General BLE release
- Corrected crashes on failed connects
- BT RSSI display working
- Possible occasional unsync on reconnect

v0.48
- Updated battery display

v0.53
- Fixed bug in SparkIO3
- Merged with SparkTracker3
- Smoothed out expression pedal noise nicely

v0.55
- Now only sends messages to connected devices
- Sometimes will do a kind of double-disconnect when the app is removed. When this happens the app can not reconnectwithout a reboot.

ToDo:
- Find out why we get bad block messages sometimes
