Based on Paul's HeltecToSpark9
---------------------------------------

v0.34
- New functionality (preset/effect) working
- All current bugs squashed

v0.35
- Reconnect working, but some bad messages come through on reconnect
- Not visible to the user but odd. Could be the hammering of get_hardware_preset

v0.36
- Reconnect working, but some bad messages come through on reconnect
- Now cause the first preset read to fail, even on first connect
- Added timer code to check battery occasionally

v0.40
- Reverted to older reconnect code. Works well enough
- Added DEFINE to automate a Heltec vs. Discrete build
- Changed switch order and polarity to match WIFI Kit version
- Code functional but debounce not working properly yet



ToDo:
- Calibrate battery scale when hardware arrives
- BT signal strength display
- Change to BTE connection
